    <h2>History of red machine</h2>
    <p>
        Aside from an abortive effort in 1940, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari" target="_blank">Ferrari</a> began racing sports cars in 1947, when the 125 S won six out of the ten races it participated in.[14] Ferrari continued to see similar luck in the years to follow: by 1957, just ten years after beginning to compete, Ferrari had won three World Sportscar Championships, seven victories in the Mille Miglia, and two victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, among many other races.[18]

This luck continued into the first half of the 1960s, when Ferrari won the WSC's 2000GT class three consecutive times and finished first at Le Mans for six consecutive years.[41][42] Its winning streak at Le Mans was broken by Ford in 1966,[42] and though Ferrari would win two more WSC titles — one in 1967 and another in 1972 — poor revenue allocation, combined with languishing performance in Formula One, led the company to cease competing in sports car events in 1973.[22]: 621  From that point onward, Ferrari would help prepare sports racing cars for privateer teams, but would not race them itself.[43]

In 2023, Ferrari reentered sports car racing in force. For the 2023 FIA World Endurance Championship, Ferrari, in partnership with AF Corse, has fielded two 499P sports prototypes. To commemorate the company's return to the discipline, one of the cars is numbered "50," referencing the fifty years that have elapsed since a works Ferrari has competed in an endurance race.[44][45] The 499P finished first at the 2023 24 Hours of Le Mans, ending Toyota's six-year winning streak and becoming the first Ferrari in 58 years to win the race.[46]

        Throughout its history, Ferrari has supplied racing cars to other entrants, aside from its own works Scuderia Ferrari team.

In the 1950s and '60s, Ferrari supplied Formula One cars to a number of private entrants and other teams. One famous example was Tony Vandervell's team, which raced the Thinwall Special modified Ferraris before building their own Vanwall cars. The North American Racing Team's entries in the final three rounds of the 1969 season were the last occasions on which a team other than Scuderia Ferrari entered a World Championship Grand Prix with a Ferrari car.[51]

Ferrari supplied cars complete with V8 engines for the A1 Grand Prix series, from the 2008–09 season.[52] The car was designed by Rory Byrne and is styled to resemble the 2004 Ferrari Formula one car.

Ferrari currently runs a customer GT program for a racing version of its 458 and has done so for the 458's predecessors, dating back to the 355 in the late 1990s. Such private teams as the American Risi Competizione and Italian AF Corse teams have been very successful with Ferrari GT racers over the years. This car, made for endurance sportscar racing to compete against such racing versions of the Audi R8, McLaren MP4-12C, and BMW Z4 (E89) has proven to be successful, but not as successful as its predecessor, the F430. The Ferrari Challenge is a one-make racing series for the Ferrari 458. The FXX is not road legal and is therefore only used for track events.
